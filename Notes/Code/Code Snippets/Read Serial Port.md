```Go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/serial"
)

func main() {
    // Open the serial port.
    port, err := serial.Open("COM1", 9600, serial.Read8Bit)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        return
    }

    // Read data from the serial port.
    data := make([]byte, 1024)
    err = port.Read(data)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        return
    }

    // Print the data.
    fmt.Println(data)
}
```


This program will open the serial port at 9600 baud and read 1024 bytes of data into the data slice. Then, it will print the data.

To run this program, you will need to replace COM1 with the serial port that you want to use. You can find the serial port number by opening the Device Manager and looking under Ports (COM & LPT).

Once you have replaced COM1 with the correct serial port number, you can compile and run the program by running the following commands:

```Go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/serial"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    // Get the serial port name.
    portName := os.Getenv("SERIAL_PORT")
    if portName == "" {
        fmt.Println("No serial port environment variable set")
        return
    }

    // Open the serial port.
    port, err := serial.Open(portName, 9600, serial.Read8Bit)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        return
    }

    // Read data from the serial port.
    data := make([]byte, 1024)
    err = port.Read(data)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        return
    }

    // Print the data.
    fmt.Println(data)
}
```


This program will open the serial port at 9600 baud and read 1024 bytes of data into the data slice. Then, it will print the data.

To run this program, you will need to set the SERIAL_PORT environment variable to the serial port that you want to use. You can find the serial port number by running the following command:

Once you have set the SERIAL_PORT environment variable, you can compile and run the program by running the following commands:
